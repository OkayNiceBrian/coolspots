# CoolSpots

This cross-platform mobile app uses React Native (JavaScript) and Spring-Boot (Java) to create an app 
that allows users to find and save cool spots throughout the world using Google and Apple maps technology. 
The React Native front-end and REST API backend were built by myself from the ground up.

Check out the RESTful API [here](https://www.github.com/OkayNiceBrian/coolspots-api).
